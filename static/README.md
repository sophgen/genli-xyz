# Static Assets Directory

This directory contains static files that will be served directly:

- `favicon.png` - Your site's favicon (recommended: 32x32 or 64x64 PNG)
- `img/` - Directory for images and other media
- Add any other static assets (CSS, JS, fonts, etc.) here

All files in this directory will be copied to the root of your published site.

I build practical AI products and data systems. With a background in optimization and machine learning engineering, I convert real business problems into reliable, measurable solutions—favoring simple designs, strong evaluation, and clean handoffs.

## Current Work

I help teams adopt Generative AI responsibly—from strategy to production:
- Evaluate use cases and prioritize by ROI and feasibility
- Design retrieval, orchestration, and evaluation pipelines
- Ship maintainable services with MLOps, monitoring, and guardrails

## Specializations in AI

- LLM applications: RAG, agents, tool use, evaluations
- Optimization and decision science
- ML systems and MLOps (observability, CI/CD, data pipelines)
- Data strategy, governance, and cost management

## Selected Projects

- Built a retrieval-augmented QA service that reduced support load
- Automated document understanding and enrichment for knowledge bases

## Principles

- Start simple; measure everything
- Production first: reliability, cost, and latency matter
- Privacy and safety by default
- Clear docs and ownership

## What Motivates Me

This site is my lab notebook: a place to capture what I learn, clarify thinking, and share practical patterns with the community.
